# Who am I ?
A curious guy who is always eager to know the reason behind `Why` and `How` and later on `What` is that? 

1) And that is how everything works. Because once you know the “Why”, you are one step to solve any problems. According to Elon Musk, knowing the Question or Issue is far more important than coming or jumping to the solution directly. 

2) And secondly, to proceed with the solution, "How" is important to know about its  implementation. 

3) And last is for the users to know about the product finally made from Solution. That is “What”

With these lines, Hello Everyone !! Myself  Vivek Kumar Sahu pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and telecommunication from Jabalpur Engineering College, India. I am an open source contributor, along with that DevOps Enthusiast. I generally loop around these technologies: Linux, Containers, kubernetes, Golang, Cloud-Native Tools, DevOps tools and Cloud Technologies.  Along with that love to discuss with these tech with my friends, always take out my time to read books related to it, and lastly try to write blogs and if not then try to explain the topic to my friends. Because the motive of writing a blog is only to explain to myself that What i have understood after learning. Hmm, that’s all about me.

# Experience
* Intern at [Nirmata](https://nirmata.com/)
*  Worked as a Intern for 3-4 months with Nirmata Cloud on one of the open source projects named as Kyverno. At present Kyverno is Incubate project of CNCF. Kyverno is a policy Engine for Kubernetes resources. It mainly has 3 types of rules: Validate, Mutate and Generate. 

* Worked as an Interned under the mentor of the maintainer of the project. I had to work on an enhancement feature for the Kyverno cli  for Mutate Rule. It was to add the support for "test" command for Mutate rule in the Kyverno CLI. "test" is a command in the Kyverno CLI which test the policies for a given resource. All these policies, resources and extra files are provided through its configuration file named as kyvero-test.yaml. "test"command simply picks this file and starts working.

* Github Link: https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/issues/1821
* Along with that also worked in solving small issues. Involved in meeting, slack discussion, github discussion ,etc. 
* Also Added many sample policies as well as resources in the kyverno/policy repository. https://github.com/kyverno/policies/issues/88
